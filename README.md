How The Gringo’s Gambit Began

Welcome to the repository for The Gringo’s Gambit, a project dedicated to shedding light on the challenges of navigating toxic work environments while exploring themes of justice, loyalty, and survival. This repository serves as a collaborative space for developing the manuscript, building character profiles, and managing thematic content.

This project started with a simple workplace complaint, written with the help of ChatGPT. At the time, I didn’t fully understand the power of AI—I just needed to document the chaos around me. When the company decided to confront me about it, they brought in their lawyer. During the conversation, their lawyer held up my complaint and said, “You could tell your lawyer this.”

I replied honestly, “I don’t have a lawyer.”

She raised the paper again and said, “Then what is this?”

I smirked and answered, “ChatGPT.”

Her response? “Do you realize this looks like a Harvard graduate wrote it?”

That’s when it hit me: AI isn’t just a tool—it’s a game-changer. The fact that an AI model could produce something so polished it left a lawyer speechless showed me its potential.

What started as a way to address a toxic workplace became the spark for a much bigger idea: using AI to empower storytelling, advocacy, and education. The Gringo’s Gambit is more than just a book; it’s a testament to resilience, creativity, and the surprising ways technology can level the playing field.
